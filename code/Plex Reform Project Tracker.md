## Issues to Address

1. **Data Challenges**
   - Handling missing or inconsistent data in some cities
   - Ensuring accurate matching of pre- and post-reform zoning districts

2. **Methodological Questions**
   - Refining the intensity measure calculation
   - Addressing potential selection into treatment
   - Exploring spatial spillover effects

3. **Robustness Checks**
   - Alternative control group specifications
   - Different time windows
   - Controlling for local economic conditions

## Notes

- Consider adding more recent reforms if data becomes available
- Explore potential implications for housing prices and affordability
- Consider supplementing with qualitative case studies
